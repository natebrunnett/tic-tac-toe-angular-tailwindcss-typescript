# Note from developer
If you are using Angular for the first time read this documentation from the official website
https://angular.io/guide/setup-local
This will show you how to install and set up your own project.

If you are cloning this tree directly, then after opening in vs code, run npm i in the directory
of the package.json to install the dependencies.  And finally '$ng serve' to launch tic-tac-toe!
